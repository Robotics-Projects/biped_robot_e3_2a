# Biped Robot

The objective of the project is to train by strengthening the AI of a bipedal robot to enable it to learn to walk autonomously and to find the optimal of movemens.  
During this project and to explore the different possibilities that Deep Learning and more particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning can offer in the field of robotics to design more autonomous achievements that can be more easily adapted to their environment. 
We modelize and train a biped to walk with ROS, Gym OpenAI and Pytorch in a simulation powered by Gazebo.

## Softwares / Libraries
- ROS Kinetic
- Pytorch
- Gazebo
- Gym OpenAI
